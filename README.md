# White Paper for Large Model Security and Privacy

The development of the Generative AI, e.g., Large Language Models (LLM), have been popular in both academic and industrial communities on a worldwide scale, especially the ChatGPT series. The success of ChatGPT and GPT4 has shown the future direction of developing AGI. 

However, large generative models also suffer from the issue of data/model security and privacy. We should note that large generative models would bring a lot of security and privacy problems, when they demonstrate great power in changing our life, such as data leaking and the propagation of fake news. 

In this white paper, we first conclude the development of large generative models, including its effects and social influences. Then, we summarize the current security and privacy problems in existing large generative models, e.g., the data and model security, copyright problems, and ethical issues. Finally, we give the corresponding suggestions about the current security and privacy problems. They can be employed to point out future research and develop directions, and can also be utilized as references for government decision-making.
